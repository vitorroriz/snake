# snake
Classic snake game implementation for a deep learning experiment.

This game will be used for an experiment on machine learning, probably within deep learning domain. 
My intetion is to make the snake learn how to play the game by itself, according to different models.

Later, I'd like to play around with different factors as: 
 - competition between concurrent Snake instances.
 - modification of the game so the "food" stops respawing randomly. Instead, it will learn the best next position
   that leads to a game over.
   
I'm using the Arcade Library[1] for graphics.
